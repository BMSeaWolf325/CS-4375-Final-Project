Stroke Prediction

This project was created as the final project for CS 4375 - Introduction to Machine Learning.

The project determines the most optimal model for stroke prediction. It uses the data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset.

This project has the following dependencies:
- numpy - https://numpy.org/install/
- scikit-learn (sklearn) - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html
- pandas - https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html
- matplotlib - https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html
- seaborn - https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html
- imbalanced-learn (imblearn) - https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/install.html

To run the project, install the dependencies and ensure that the data (healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv) is in the same file location as the jupyter notebook (Final Project Code.ipynb).
NOTE: The data is included in the zip file.
